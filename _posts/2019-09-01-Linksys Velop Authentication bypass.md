## Linksys Velop Authentication Bypass


### Affected Software
Firmware version:	Before 1.1.8.192419
### Product Background
Velop is WHOLE HOMEMESH Wi-Fi system from LINKSYS. It allows users enjoy fast, nonstop Wi-Fi everywhere with Velopâ€™s modular easy-to-use Wi-Fi Mesh system.
There are three categories from their official site :WHW0303,WHW0302,WHW0301. The differences between these three is the pack count: 1, 2 or 3. The system is the same.
### Vulnerability Details
During our analysis, we found a critical bug in its firmware and this vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated user get administrator privilege. The problem is caused by the API of **/sysinfo_json.cgi**, requesting this url will leak sensitive information and may lead to authentication bypass.
#### PoC
We could get some useful information from the PoC below:

The most important value we can get is WPS PIN and Device Recovery Key. For the WPS PIN, we can use it to connect to the wifi even if the wifi password is changed when wps is enabled. Recovery key can be used to reset the admin password, we may construct the following request to change the admin password:
